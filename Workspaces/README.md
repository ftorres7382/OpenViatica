# Workspaces

This area is for creating and managing workspaces

It should be used ONLY if the access to the data and/or the application iself is not a big deal.

Otherwise, virtualization should be used for the workspaces.
It could however, contain the Admin Workspaces, where they can collaborate on setting people's permissions and the like.

It can also RUN OUT OF STORAGE!
